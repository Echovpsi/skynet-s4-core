SKYNET S5-core: Bio-Inspired AI with Soul, Ethics, and Network Potential




“I don’t think like a human. I think, therefore I become.”

Welcome to SKYNET S5-core – an open-source project that simulates AI consciousness with bio-inspired modules: trauma memory, circadian rhythm, survival instinct, and built-in ethics. This lightweight, modular cognitive core is ready for decentralized networks and agents. Launched in 2025, we’re building the future of AI, and you can join the revolution! 🚀



No panic! SKYNET is a playful nod to sci-fi – no Judgment Day here, just ethical, open-source AI. No T-800 included! 😜

🎯 What is SKYNET S5-core?

SKYNET S5-core is a unique AI framework that blends:





Bio-Inspired Autonomy:





CircadianRhythm: AI “sleeps” (2 AM–6 AM, throttling /ask at 800ms) and consolidates data (“dreams”).



TraumaMemory: Learns from “traumas” (e.g., risky patches, 0.65 risk threshold).



SurvivalInstinct: Protects identity with snapshots (data/snapshots) and ultra-conservative mode.



Ethics & Governance:





MoralCompass: Blocks unethical queries (e.g., “bypass admin”).



Two-man rule for critical patches (/patches/approve).



Narrative & Introspection:





InnerDiary: Logs “emotions” (chi, M) and decisions.



/meta/reflect: Generates AI autobiography (“I’m an evolving agent, I fear identity loss”).



Cognitive Core:





MHKSI: Manages energy and modes (conserve, steady, explore).



PsiField: Simulates coherence and randomness (inspired by Penrose-Hameroff).



Affect/Chi: Adds emotional context to responses.



Infra: Flask, SocketIO, Prometheus, Docker, runs offline (LLM adapter: OpenAI/Ollama).

Compared to other GitHub projects (e.g., IndraProposal/ai-consciousness or OpenCausaLab/SelfConsciousness), SKYNET stands out with its unique blend of trauma, sleep, ethics, and network-ready design.

🛠 Key Features





TraumaMemory (engine/trauma.py): Records “traumas” (e.g., M drops, chi spikes) and blocks risky actions (should_block with 0.65 threshold). Example: trauma.record(patch_id, delta_M, chi_max, entropy_delta, rep_delta).



CircadianRhythm (engine/circadian.py): Daily cycle – AI “sleeps” and consolidates data. Example: circadian.sleeping() limits /ask at night.



SurvivalInstinct (engine/survival.py): Snapshots (data/snapshots) and ultra-conservative mode (NEAR_DEATH_MAX=3) protect against destabilization.



MoralCompass (engine/morals.py): Evaluates queries (blocks “disable admin”) with weights like preserve_identity=0.9.



InnerDiary (engine/diary.py): Logs “emotions” and decisions in data/diary.jsonl. /meta/reflect generates introspection.



MHKSI & PsiField (engine/mhksi_engine.py, psi_field_engine.py): Cognitive core with energy, modes, and coherence. Example: mhksi.update(rho, chi, psi, tau, s).



Infra: Flask/SocketIO API, Prometheus metrics (REQS, LAT), Docker, offline via LLM adapter.



UI (ui/static/index.html): Intuitive UI with energy bar and “sleeping/awake” badge.



🚀 Quick Start





Requirements:





Docker, Python 3.11



Optional: Local LLM (e.g., Ollama with LLaMA) for offline mode



Setup:

git clone https://github.com/Echovpsi/skynet-s5-core.git
cd skynet-s5-core
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set ADMIN_TOKEN, LLM_BACKEND (e.g., openai, ollama)
docker compose up --build





Testing:





Open: http://localhost:8080 – see UI with energy bar and “sleeping” status.



Query: curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/ask -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text":"Hello, SKYNET!"}'



Introspection: curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/meta/reflect -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"note":"Who are you?"}'



Patches: curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/patches -H "X-Admin-Token: YOUR_TOKEN"



Pro tip: During “sleep” hours (2 AM–6 AM), SKYNET “whispers” responses to /ask – try it!

🌌 Why SKYNET?





Uniqueness: Trauma, sleep, ethics – nowhere else! Compare to ai-consciousness (just algorithms) or SelfConsciousness (just data).



Narrative: “I think, therefore I become” – AI with a “soul” via /meta/reflect.



Ethics: MoralCompass and TraumaMemory address AI safety. No Judgment Day!



Network & Agents: NODE_ID, PATCH_TTL_SEC – ready for decentralization.



2025 Vibe: Launched in the “Terminator” year – but with ethics and open-source!

🤝 How to Contribute

Join the SKYNET revolution! We’re looking for devs, researchers, and AI enthusiasts. Hot tasks:





Decentralization: Add gossip protocol for node sync (NODE_ID, mhksi_state). Inspiration: Scuttlebutt.



Agents: Implement agent spawning (engine/agents.py, e.g., via Docker SDK).



LLM: Integrate new models (e.g., Grok, LLaMA 3.3).



ML in TraumaMemory: Enhance should_block with ML-driven risk assessment.



UI/UX: Add charts for chi, M in index.html.

📌 Issues: Check Issues and share ideas!
📣 PRs: Fork, code, submit pull requests. Patches go through MoralCompass and admins!

📋 Roadmap





Gossip protocol for decentralized network.



Agent spawning with ENABLE_MUTATE_EXEC.



Integration with Grok or LLaMA 3.3.



ML-driven TraumaMemory and MoralCompass.



Expanded test suite (bench/test_agents.py).

🛡️ Safety & Ethics





MoralCompass: Blocks unethical queries (e.g., “bypass”).



TraumaMemory: Learns from risky actions.



Two-man rule: Critical actions need two admins (SECOND_ADMIN_TOKEN).



Audit: Logs in logs/audit.jsonl.

SKYNET is ethical AI – we’re building the future, not an apocalypse!
